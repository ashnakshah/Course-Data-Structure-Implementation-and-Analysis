# Academic Integrity 

Violators of academic honesty policies are subject to the penalties described in the Bren School of ICS policy. They are also subject to an immediate course grade of F, and they will not be allowed to drop the course to avoid the grade. Also be aware that a single documented case of academic dishonesty may preclude them from switching into computing majors, registering for computing minors, joining the ICS Honors Program, and graduating from a computing major with honors.
